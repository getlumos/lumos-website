We're excited to announce the first stable release of **LUMOS** - a type-safe schema language designed specifically for Solana development.

## The Problem

Building on Solana means working with two very different ecosystems:

- **Rust** for on-chain programs
- **TypeScript** for client applications

Keeping type definitions synchronized between these two worlds has always been a pain point. Manual updates lead to bugs, and serialization mismatches can cause transaction failures.

## The Solution

LUMOS lets you define your data structures once in `.lumos` syntax and automatically generates:

- **Rust structs** with proper Borsh derives and Anchor integration
- **TypeScript interfaces** with matching Borsh schemas

```lumos
#[solana]
#[account]
struct PlayerAccount {
    wallet: PublicKey,
    level: u16,
    experience: u64,
    equipped_items: [PublicKey],
}
```

## Key Features

### Single Source of Truth

Define schemas once, generate everywhere. No more manual synchronization.

### Type Safety

Catch type mismatches at compile time, not runtime. The generated code is guaranteed to serialize and deserialize correctly.

### Anchor Integration

LUMOS understands Anchor. Use `#[account]` to generate Anchor-compatible structs with proper space calculations.

### Multi-Language Support

Beyond Rust and TypeScript, LUMOS now supports Python, Go, and Ruby code generation.

## Getting Started

Install the CLI:

```bash
cargo install lumos-cli
```

Create a schema file:

```bash
lumos init my-project
```

Generate code:

```bash
lumos generate schema.lumos
```

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Check out our [roadmap](/roadmap) to see what's coming, and join the [community](/community) to help shape the future of LUMOS.
