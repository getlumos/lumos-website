# Introducing LUMOS

We're excited to introduce **LUMOS** - a type-safe schema language designed specifically for Solana development.

## The Problem

Building Solana programs requires maintaining separate type definitions in Rust (on-chain) and TypeScript (client-side). This duplication leads to:

- **Type mismatches** between on-chain and off-chain code
- **Serialization bugs** from manual Borsh implementation
- **Maintenance overhead** keeping both codebases in sync
- **Developer friction** switching between languages

## The Solution

LUMOS provides a single source of truth for your data structures:

```rust
#[solana]
#[account]
struct PlayerAccount {
    wallet: PublicKey,
    level: u16,
    experience: u64,
}
```

This generates:
- **Rust**: Anchor-compatible structs with automatic derives
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe interfaces with Borsh schemas
- **Guaranteed compatibility**: No more serialization mismatches

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
- 🔄 **Bidirectional Generation**: Rust ↔ TypeScript
- 📦 **Borsh Compatible**: Guaranteed serialization compatibility
- ⚡ **Anchor Integration**: Works seamlessly with Anchor framework
- 🛠️ **Developer Experience**: CLI, LSP, and editor support

## Getting Started

Install LUMOS CLI:

```bash
cargo install lumos-cli
```

Create your first schema:

```bash
lumos init my-project
lumos generate schema.lumos
```

## What's Next?

- VSCode extension with full IntelliSense
- More Solana-specific types
- Advanced validation rules
- IDE plugins for IntelliJ, Neovim, and more

Join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/getlumos) and start building type-safe Solana programs today!
